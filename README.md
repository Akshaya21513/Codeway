<h1>CODEWAY</h1>

<p>Here are a few of the Machine learning projects I worked on as part of my Codeway virtual internship:</p>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Codeway_TaskNo1 : MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION</strong></summary>
  <i>TASK: Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.</i><br><br>
